My first blog post! I finally have taken the time to set up a blog.  "But it's so easy?", says anyone reading this who already has one.  Well, yes, I find that it is...but only thanks to what I have been learning at Maker Square here in Austin, TX.  For anyone not familiar with this program, check it out at http://www.themakersquare.com/.  I am loving the course so far and have learned a lot.
I'll bore you in a later post with why I made the decision to change careers paths and take on the daunting task of attempting to become a programmer, but for now I just wanted to get this up and running!
I am taking today off after working all weekend on our first hackathon project: building a web app (in my case, a very, very simple, non-functional web app!! check out out here: http://mks-store-my-stuff.herokuapp.com/form?name=Ian+White&user_name=Iawhite76&phone=201+471+1000&email=ianwhite%40utexas.edu&zip=78744).  I did NOT build what you see on my own.  Thank god I had the exceptional talent of my two other teammates Zalary and Todd to get this project done.  Although the app isn't entirely what we had hope to accomplish, it is still an amazing acheivement given that we've only been at Maker Square 3 weeks!  Many thanks to them for putting up and motivating me.  Despite all my frustrated bitching, I enjoyed working on this project and feel I learned just a little bit (although I definitely needed more preparation).
Thanks for reading.  Until next time.
